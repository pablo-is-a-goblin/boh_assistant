A web app to access to a database related to the videogame Book of Hours.

⚠️WARNING: THIS PROYECT IS A WIP⚠️

In the videogame Book of Hours you play as the librarian of an occult library and there is a lot of information to manage: books, memories, recipies, skills. This web app intends to be an easy way to organize all this data


## Lessons Learned

I am still finishing the proyect, but so long I have learned to use the following technologies:
- Django, a Python framework
- React, a JavaScript framework
- PostgreSQL, a SQL database
I also learned about:
- Using the Entity-Relation model to design a database
- Connect Django and React with a REST API using DjangoREST and axios
- Using Bootstrap with React to give a glow up to the frontend
